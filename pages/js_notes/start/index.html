        What is JavaScript? Why JavaScript is called client validation language?
    </h2>
</a>

<p>
    JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used As a part of webpages, Whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
</p>

<p>
    Client side JavaScript is the most common form of the language.The script should be included in or reference by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser. The JavaScript client side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI(common gateway interface) server side scripts. For example we may use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail ID in a form field. The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the web browser. Thus JavaScript is known as client validation language.
