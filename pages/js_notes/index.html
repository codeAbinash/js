        What is JavaScript? Why JavaScript is called client validation language? Write down the
        advantages of JavaScript. What are the limitations of JavaScript
    </h2>
</a>

<p>
    JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used As a part of webpages, Whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
</p>

<p>
    Clientside JavaScript is the most common form of the language.The script should be included in or reference by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser. The JavaScript client side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI(common gateway interface) server side scripts. For example we may use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail ID in a form field. The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the web browser. Thus JavaScript is known as client validation language.
</p>
<p>
    The following are the various advantages of JavaScript.
</p>

<h2>1. Interpreted Language</h2>
<p>
    It is an interpreted language,which requires no compilation steps. This provides an easy development process. The syntax is completely interpreted by the browser just as it interprets HTML tags. 
</p>

<h2>2. Embedded Within HTML</h2>
<p>
    javascript does not require Any special or separate editor for programs to be written, edited or compiled. It can be written in any text editor like Notepad, along with appropriate HTML tags, and saved as file name <span class="incode">.html</span>. HTML files with embedded JavaScript commands can be read and interpreted by any browser that is JavaScript enabled.
</p>

<h2>3. Minimal syntax / Easy to learn</h2>
<p>
    By learning just a few comments and simple rules of syntax, complete application can be built using JavaScript.
</p>

<h2>4. Quick developments</h2>
<p>
    Because JavaScript does not require time consuming compilations, scripts can be developed in a short period of time. This is enchanted by the fact that many GUI interfaces features, such as alerts, prompts, confirm boxes, and other GUI elements are handled by the client side JavaScript, the browser and HTML code.
</p>

<h2>5. Procedural capabilities</h2>
<p>
    Every programming language needs to Support facilities searches condition checking, loop and branching. JavaScript provides syntax, which can be used to add such procedural capabilities to web page coding.
</p>

<h2>6. Easy debugging in testing</h2>
<p>
    Being an interpreted language Kumar script in JavaScript are tested land by line Kumar and the errors are also listed as they are encountered, Dad is an appropriate error messagealong with the line number is listed for every error that is encountered. It is thus easy to locate errors, Make changes and taste it again without the overhead delay of compiling.
</p>

<h2>7. Design for simple / small programs</h2>
<p>
    It is well suited to implementKumar small programs Kumar sad programs can be easily written executive at acceptable speed using JavaScript. in addition, they can be easily integrated into a webpage.
</p>

<h2>8. Platform Independence / Architecture Neutral</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript is a programming language that is completely independent of the hardware in which it works. It is a language that is understood by any JavaScript enabled browser. Thus, JavaScript application works on any machine that has an appropriate JavaScript browser installed. It can work anywhere or the network.
